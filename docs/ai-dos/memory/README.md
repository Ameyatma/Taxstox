## Architect Agent — Session Protocol

Every session, the Architect Agent:

### On Session Start

1. **Read this index** (memory/README.md)
2. **Read recent Decisions** (Decisions.md — last 10 decisions)
3. **Read Architecture** (Architecture.md — current state)
4. **Check Known Issues** (KnownIssues.md — any new P0/P1?)
5. **Check Technical Debt** (TechnicalDebt.md — any items past deadline?)
6. **Determine what changed** since last session

### During Session

7. **Update relevant files** as work happens
8. **Add decisions** to Decisions.md as they're made
9. **Register new issues** in KnownIssues.md as they're found
10. **Register new debt** in TechnicalDebt.md as it's incurred
11. **Update Architecture.md** if architecture changes
12. **Update BusinessRules.md** if business understanding evolves
13. **Update TaxRules.md** when rules are implemented or changed
14. **Update InterviewLogic.md** when interview flow changes
15. **Update CompletedFeatures.md** when features ship
16. **Capture future ideas** in FutureIdeas.md

### On Session End

17. **Update session log** at the bottom of every changed file
18. **Write session summary** to sessions/YYYY-MM-DD/session-N.md
19. **Commit all memory changes** with message: `memory: session update YYYY-MM-DD`

## File Dependencies

```
Architecture.md ──── defines system structure
    │
    ├── BusinessRules.md ──── business logic that architecture must support
    │   ├── FinanceAct.md ──── legal versioning of business rules
    │   └── TaxRules.md ────── implemented rules catalog
    │
    ├── InterviewLogic.md ──── UX architecture for data collection
    │
    ├── CompletedFeatures.md ─ what's built (output of architecture)
    ├── KnownIssues.md ─────── what's broken (feedback loop)
    ├── TechnicalDebt.md ───── what's owed (architecture violations)
    ├── Decisions.md ───────── why we chose this way (architecture rationale)
    └── FutureIdeas.md ─────── where we're going (architecture evolution)
```

## Consistency Rules

1. **Architecture.md is the source of truth.** All other files must be consistent with it.
2. **Decisions.md explains Architecture.md.** Every architecture choice should have a decision record.
3. **BusinessRules.md drives TaxRules.md.** Business understanding precedes implementation.
4. **CompletedFeatures.md + KnownIssues.md + TechnicalDebt.md = current project health.** These three files together give a complete picture.
5. **No contradictions.** If two memory files disagree, Architecture.md wins, and the contradiction must be resolved.
